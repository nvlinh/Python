 A few styling issues related to classes are worth clarifying, especially
 as your programs become more complicated.
 Class names should be written in CamelCase. To do this, capitalize the
 first letter of each word in the name, and don’t use underscores. Instance
 and module names should be written in lowercase with underscores between
 words.
 Every class should have a docstring immediately following the class
 definition. The docstring should be a brief description of
 what the class does, and you should follow the same formatting conventions
 you used for writing docstrings in functions. Each module should also have
 a docstring describing what the classes in a module can be used for.
 You can use blank lines to organize code, but don’t use them excessively.
 Within a class you can use one blank line between methods, and
 within a module you can use two blank lines to separate classes.
