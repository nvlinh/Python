In this chapter you will learn how to write your own classes. You will learn
how to store information in a class using attributes and how to write
methods that give your classes the behavior they need. You will learn to
write __init__() methods that create instances from your classes with
exactly the attributes you want. You see how to modify the attributes of
an instance directly and through methods. You will learn that inheritance
can simplify the creation of classes that are related to each other, and you
will learn to use instances of one class as attributes in another class to keep
each class simple.
You see how storing classes in modules and importing classes you need
into the files where theyâ€™ll be used can keep your projects organized. You
started learning about the Python standard library, and you see an example
based on the random module. Finally, you will learn to style your classes using
Python conventions.
