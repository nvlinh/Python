In this chapter you will learn how to write conditional tests, which always
evaluate to True or False. You will learn to write simple if statements, if-else
chains, and if-elif-else chains. You began using these structures to identify
particular conditions you needed to test and to know when those conditions
have been met in your programs. You will learn to handle certain items in a
list differently than all other items while continuing to utilize the efficiency
of a for loop. You also revisited Pythonâ€™s style recommendations to ensure
that your increasingly complex programs are still relatively easy to read and
understand.
