you will learn how to write functions and to pass arguments
so that your functions have access to the information they need to do their
work. You will learn how to use positional and keyword arguments, and how
to accept an arbitrary number of arguments. You see functions that display
output and functions that return values. You will learn how to use functions
with lists, dictionaries, if statements, and while loops. You also see how to
store your functions in separate files called modules, so your program files
will be simpler and easier to understand. Finally, you will learn to style your
functions so your programs will continue to be well-structured and as easy
as possible for you and others to read.
