Windows systems use a backslash (\) instead of a forward slash (/) when displaying
file paths, but you can still use forward slashes in your code.

* Relative paths and absolute file path:
1. Relative paths: same folder with file .py ex 'text_files/linh_note.txt'
2. Absolute file path: file_path = '/home/ehmatthes/other_files/text_files/filename.txt'
