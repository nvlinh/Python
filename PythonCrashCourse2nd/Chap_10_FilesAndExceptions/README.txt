You will learn how to work with files. You will learn to read an
entire file at once and read through a file’s contents one line at a time. You
will learn to write to a file and append text onto the end of a file. You read
about exceptions and how to handle the exceptions you’re likely to see in
your programs. Finally, you will learn how to store Python data structures so
you can save information your users provide, preventing them from having
to start over each time they run a program.
